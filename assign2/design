First the connection between the client and the proxy server is established.
The proxy server receives the http request into buffer.
Then it splits the buffer into three strings. The first string will have "GET", second the url and the third will have the http version "HTTP/1.0".
The proxy server then searches whether the url contain the port number of the host. If it is present, flag is initialised to 1 and the port number is stored in variable 'port'. Else the variable port will contain 80 (default http port number).
The host is stored in 'host' and the function gethostbyname is used to get the host address.
If there is a path in the url, it is searched and stored in 'path' variable.
Then the proxy server make the http request using the above values.
Now the proxy server tries to connect to the host and sends the http request. It then receives the response message and sends this to the client.
